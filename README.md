# Bash Battle Arena

This repository contains my solutions to the Bash Battle Arena challenge.
Each level is a separate `.sh` script that completes a Bash-related task.

---

## Levels & Missions

### Level 1 – The Basics
Create a directory named `Arena` and then inside it, create three files: `warrior.txt`, `mage.txt`, and `archer.txt`.
List the contents of the `Arena` directory.

---

### Level 2 – Variables and Loops
Create a script that outputs the numbers 1 to 10, one number per line.

---

### Level 3 – Conditional Statements
Write a script that checks if a file named `hero.txt` exists in the `Arena` directory.
If it does, print `Hero found!`; otherwise, print `Hero missing!`.

---

### Level 4 – File Manipulation
Create a script that copies all `.txt` files from the `Arena` directory to a new directory called `Backup`.

---

### Level 5 – Boss Battle: Combining Basics
Combine what you've learned! Write a script that:

1. Creates a directory named `Battlefield`
2. Inside `Battlefield`, create files named `knight.txt`, `sorcerer.txt`, and `rogue.txt`
3. Checks if `knight.txt` exists; if it does, move it to a new directory called `Archive`
4. Lists the contents of both `Battlefield` and `Archive`

---

### Level 6 – Argument Parsing
Write a script that accepts a filename as an argument and prints the number of lines in that file.
If no filename is provided, display a message saying: `No file provided`.
