# Bash Battle Arena

This repository contains my solutions to the Bash Battle Arena challenge.

Each level is a separate '.sh' script that completes a Bash-related task.
---

## Levels & Missions
### 'Level1.sh': The Basics
Mission: Create a directory named Arena and then inside it, create three files: warrior.txt, mage.txt, and archer.txt. List the contents of the Arena directory.
---

### 'Level2.sh': Variables and Loops
Mission: Create a script that outputs the numbers 1 to 10, one number per line.
---

### 'Level3.sh': Conditional Statements
Mission: Write a script that checks if a file named hero.txt exists in the Arena directory. If it does, print Hero found!; otherwise, print Hero missing!.
---

### 'Level4.sh': File Manipulation
Mission: Create a script that copies all .txt files from the Arena directory to a new directory called Backup.
---

### 'Level5.sh': The Boss Battle - Combining Basics
Mission: Combine what you've learned! Write a script that:

1. Creates a directory names 'Battlefield'
2. Inside Battlefield, create files named knight.txt, sorcerer.txt, and rogue.txt.
3. Check if knight.txt exists; if it does, move it to a new directory called Archive.
4. List the contents of both Battlefield and Archive.

### 'Level6.sh': Argument Parsing
Mission: Write a script that accepts a filename as an argument and prints the number of lines in that file. If no filename is provided, display a message saying 'No file provided'.
